RepairTech - Privacy Policy

At RepairTech, we gather data in order to keep the world informed about the most current
problems and issues facing the computer repair industry. We want to collect robust data that
can give us insights about things like hardware failure rates and virus trends, so we can bring
that information back to the community and make us all smarter, safer and stronger.
While we do collect information, it is of utmost importance that we operate with transparency
and honor with respect to our customers. This document outlines our procedures and practices
for gathering, using, and distributing the data we may collect.
Website and Forum Visitors

As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal
information. For example, visitors may view most of the threads on our help forum and help
desk without signing up for a user name or providing any personal information.
Those who wish to sign up for the RepairTech forums or use certain online or hosted products
and services may do so by voluntarily filling out and submitting a user information form. It is
optional for users to engage in these activities, but for those who wish to do so, filling out certain
fields in the user forms will be mandatory.

Users who do not provide the mandatory data in the user form for a particular activity will not be able to engage in that activity.

RepairTech may also collect certain information about users' computers when they access the
RepairTech website or use certain products and services. This information is used to facilitate
and evaluate your use of the RepairTech website or other products and services. For example,
we may track what web browser a website visitor uses to ensure that all of the website features
work properly in that browser environment. We may also log environmental variables, such
as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit webpages, and the Internet
Protocol (IP) address of users' computers. RepairTech also uses such information to measure
traffic patterns on the Site and usage of the Products and Services. We do not match such
information with any other information held by RepairTech unless we have a user's consent.
Software Users

In addition to information collected by our website and user forms, RepairTech software
also collects certain additional information from users of our repair software. In particular,
RepairTech keeps a record of Computer Hardware Specifications, Operating System
specifications, TechUSB and D7 reported results, Feature Requests, Bug Reports, and User
Feedback, Debug Logs, IP addresses, TechDB Search Results and User Suggestions, and
Email Addresses.

This information is important to allow RepairTech to better protect all of its users against threats
as soon as they emerge. RepairTech’s software also sends data to our servers concerning how
many users are logging on to the server at any given time and what version of RepairTech the
users are running. These usage statistics help RepairTech keep its software running smoothly
and minimize service interruptions. Much of this information is collected in the aggregate, with
no way for RepairTech to track individual users' information.

Lastly, for users of the full version of RepairTech’s software, RepairTech does track usage of its
licenses to protect against software piracy and malicious companies who attempt to circumvent
RepairTech protection by using stolen license keys.

Billing Information and 3rd Party Companies

We don’t store your billing information on our servers. We use Stripe, which is a PCI Compliant
Payment Processor, in order to keep your billing information secure.
As far as sharing your personal information with 3rd party companies, we don’t do that.
Period. We will never distribute your email address or any of your other personal information.

How do we collect and use information?

We collect this information through registration and login forms on our website, and
through the uploaded log files from TechUSB and D7. We use metrics and data gathered from
web interactions to understand where our users are coming from, how they arrive at our site,
and what features they use most.

We use log information from TechUSB and D7 to measure the efficiency and
effectiveness of our products. Eventually, we intend to parse and analyze data from uploaded
logs and our website in order to create reports and data packages regarding the state of the
computer repair industry. These reports may include trends, failure rates, brand related data or
other information that may help educate and strengthen the computer repair industry.

Your Agreement to this Privacy Policy

By using this Site and our other products and services, you agree and acknowledge that
personal information collected through the Site or in connection with the Products and Services
may be transferred across national boundaries and stored and processed in any of the countries
around the world in which RepairTech maintains offices, including the United States.
